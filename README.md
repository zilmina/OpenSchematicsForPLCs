# OpenSchematicsForPLCs
The PLC Schematic Library is an open-source repository for KiCad dedicated to offering a centralized collection of schematic diagrams for Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) from various manufacturers. Our goal is to create a valuable resource for engineers by providing detailed circuit diagrams that follow reference designs.
