# OpenSchematicsForPLCs
The PLC Schematic Library is an open-source repository for KiCad dedicated to offering a centralized collection of schematic diagrams for Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) from various manufacturers. Our goal is to create a valuable resource for engineers by providing detailed circuit diagrams that follow reference designs. 

## Project Overview

The PLC Schematic Library aims to provide comprehensive and detailed schematic diagrams for various PLC systems, ensuring that users have access to high-quality, accurate, and open-source circuit designs. This library includes designs from multiple manufacturers, unified under a single repository to streamline access and collaboration. Contributors are encouraged to adhere to reference designs provided in product datasheets and to create rich, component-accurate schematics using KiCad. This project is designed to support both educational and professional needs in the automation industry.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plc-schematic-library.git
    cd plc-schematic-library
    ```

2. **Install KiCad**:
    - Download and install KiCad from the official website: [KiCad EDA](https://kicad.org/)

3. **Open the Project**:
    - Open KiCad and load the project files from the cloned repository.

## Usage

1. **Open a Schematic**:
    - In KiCad, navigate to the `src` directory and open the desired schematic file.

2. **Explore Examples**:
    - Check the `examples` directory for sample schematics and usage examples.

3. **Documentation**:
    - Detailed documentation and tutorials can be found in the `docs` directory.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. To ensure consistency and high quality, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Adhere to Reference Designs**:
    - All schematics must follow the reference designs provided in the product datasheets.

2. **Create Detailed Schematics**:
    - Use KiCad to create rich, component-accurate schematics that reflect the true shapes and configurations of components.

3. **File Formats**:
    - Include necessary Gerber files, BOM (Bill of Materials), and CPL (Component Placement List).

4. **Focus on Component Reduction**:
    - Prioritize reducing the number of components over noise reduction when designing for JLCPCB.

5. **PCBA Compatibility**:
    - Ensure designs are as ready for PCBA (Printed Circuit Board Assembly) as possible to minimize the need for soldering by OSS users.

6. **Contributor Recognition**:
    - Contributors are encouraged to include their names and logs on the test boards. Please use the recommended settings:
      - Printable area: 2 cmÂ² in the lower-right corner.
      - Font size: Minimum of 1.5 mm for readability.

## JLCPCB Guidelines

To facilitate easy and cost-effective PCB manufacturing, follow these guidelines for JLCPCB orders:

1. **Recommended Components**:
    - Select cost-effective and readily available components.

2. **Ordering Steps**:
    1. Create a JLCPCB account.
    2. Upload the necessary files (Gerber, BOM, CPL).
    3. Confirm settings (board size, layers, finish).
    4. Review the quote to ensure low cost.
    5. Complete the order.

3. **File Examples**:
    - Gerber files for PCB design.
    - BOM for the list of components.
    - CPL for component placement.

## Benefits for Contributors

- **Community Trust and Recognition**: Gain trust and recognition within the open-source community.
- **Professional Skill Enhancement**: Improve your circuit design and KiCad skills through real-world projects.
- **Star and Fork Achievements**: See your work appreciated by many through stars and forks.
- **Networking Opportunities**: Connect with other engineers and developers.
- **Learning and Growth**: Stay updated with new technologies and best practices.
- **Visibility for Job Seekers**: Contributors seeking employment can have their email addresses and corresponding folders listed in the README.md for professional visibility.
